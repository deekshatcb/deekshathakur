excerpt: 'To associate exonic variation(s) with the protein systematically, we designed the ENACT framework for uniquely annotating exons that tracks their loci in gene architecture context with encapsulating variations in splice site(s) and amino acid coding status. Thus, ENACT provides trackable exonic variation(s) association to isoform(s) and protein features enabling the assessment of functional variation due to changes in exon composition.'
