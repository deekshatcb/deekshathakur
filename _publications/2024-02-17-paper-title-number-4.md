In this study, we have systematically studied the structural attributes of the ligand binding/catalytic residues of known promiscuous and specialist enzymes. The flexibility of substrate binding sites as measured using B-factor, dynamic flexibility index, and graph theoretical approaches showed that these are similar between specialist and generalist. Further, our analysis coherently indicates structural invariability of the enzymes, which are functionally different in terms of their ability to catalyze alternate substrates. This coherence over a range of structural features suggests that promiscuous enzymes and specialist enzymes broadly share similar attributes.
