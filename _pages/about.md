Hello and Welcome!

I am a PhD graduate, trained as a computational structural biologist in [ISCB lab](https://shashibp-lab.github.io/projects/), with a passion for analyzing data and uncovering the hidden stories within. I enjoy making sense of complex datasets and revealing the insights buried beneath the surface. 

I’m fascinated by biological signaling, where every component interacts intricately to regulate the processes of life. The complexity and robustness of biological systems, with multiple layers of control, never cease to amaze me. As scientists, we strive to comprehend this grand orchestration, yet our understanding is just a small glimpse into the marvels of life itself. As scientists, we not only delve deep to understand these intricacies but also draw inspiration from nature’s grand orchestration to create something meaningful. My PhD research focuses on one of nature’s molecular machines—enzymes. These catalysts drive the molecular transformations that are essential for life, acting as the alchemists behind the biochemical processes that sustain living organisms.
