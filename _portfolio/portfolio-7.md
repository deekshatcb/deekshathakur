I contributed towards enhancement of the functional understanding of the protein actinodin by identifying key functional signals through SLiMs (Short Linear Motifs) identification. This method allowed for a detailed analysis of actinodin's structure and function, providing valuable insights into its molecular mechanisms and potential biological significance.
