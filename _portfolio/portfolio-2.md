To evaluate the hypothesis that substrate promiscuity might be a continuum feature rather than a binary property, we analyzed the conformational diversity in the binding site of enzymes through equilibrium MD-simulations. Through binding site featurization and dimensionality reduction through tICA, we analyzed the conformational landscape of enzymes by clustering the conformations and assessing their binding site variability through structural and functional scores. These scores included RMSD, RMSF and a functional variability score. This work demonstrates the presence of a broad range of conformational variation in the case of specialist enzymes (as well), which has previously been argued to be a unique property of promiscuous enzymes. This work highlights the underappreciated existence of substrate promiscuity owing to dearth of substrate profiling experiments under appropriate conditions.
