I conducted experiments demonstrating that transitioning the carbon source from glucose to galactonate induces a diauxic growth curve when cultivated in minimal media. This observation underscores the necessity of a diauxic period for the production of enzymes and other cellular machinery crucial for metabolizing galactonate as the primary carbon source.
