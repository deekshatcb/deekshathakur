Insights into the structural basis of substrate promiscuity would greatly benefit the design and engineering of enzymes. We carefully constructed dataset of substrate promiscuous and specialist enzymes. On careful analysis, surprisingly, we found that substrate promiscuous and specialist enzymes are similar in various binding/catalytic site structural features such as flexibility, surface area, hydrophobicity, depth, and secondary structures. Recent studies have also alluded that promiscuity is widespread among enzymes. Based on these observations, we propose that substrate promiscuity could be defined as a continuum feature that varies from narrow (specialist) to broad range of substrate preferences. Moreover, diversity of conformational states of an enzyme accessible for ligand binding may possibly regulate its substrate preferences.
