We divided the protein structure into communities based on residue correlation obtained from the consensus of three simulation replicates. Using the same three replicates we also identified locally frustrated regions in the protein structure based on the principle of minimum frustration. Utilizing the graph-based approach we analyzed the association of these frustrated regions with the active site of enzymes. This unique approach highlighted the potential allosteric hotspots on the enzyme surface which can be harnessed to modulate enzymes’ activity.
