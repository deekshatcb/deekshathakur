I implemented the E. coli metabolic reconstruction iJO1366 and model simulations suggested that a Î”icl (isocitrate lyase) mutant knockout would grow normally in oleate M9 medium. However, experimental results showed defective growth, consistent with prior studies highlighting ICL's importance during fatty acid metabolism. Despite this, in silico simulations indicated normal growth, suggesting flux rerouting compensating for the ICL deletion. Analysis revealed flux diversion towards ICDHyr instead of ICL, with unexpected pyruvate synthesis from Acetyl CoA. Fixing this reaction's directionality redirected fluxes through ICL, confirming its essential role in the absence of alternative pathways, as validated by null phenotype upon ICL deletion.
