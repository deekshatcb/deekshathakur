We developed a nomenclature to systematically address the challenges faced while dealing with multiple transcripts arising from alternate splicing of mRNA. Leveraging ENACT annotated exonic entities, we carefully integrate wealth of protein features (secondary structure/disorder/pfam domains) on isoforms and represent them in visually appealing containers, simplifying the functional variability assessment introduced by splicing and associated processes.
